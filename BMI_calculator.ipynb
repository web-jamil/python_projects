    "Here’s a **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** implemented using **Python** with an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach. The BMI calculator computes a person's BMI based on their weight and height, then classifies the result into categories like underweight, normal, overweight, and obese.\n",

    "### **Explanation of the Code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BMICalculator Class**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`__init__`**: Initializes the weight and height attributes of the person.\n",
    "   - **`calculate_bmi`**: Calculates BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2`. If the height is entered in centimeters, it converts it to meters.\n",
    "   - **`classify_bmi`**: Classifies the BMI into categories: \"Underweight\", \"Normal weight\", \"Overweight\", and \"Obese\".\n",
    "   - **`display_bmi_info`**: This method combines the BMI calculation and classification, then returns a formatted string with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `get_user_input` function prompts the user for input, ensures the values are valid, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Program Logic**:\n",
    "   - The program asks the user for their weight and height. If the input is invalid, it keeps asking until the input is valid.\n",
    "   - It then creates an instance of the `BMICalculator` class with the user input and displays the calculated BMI and its classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the BMI is Calculated**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BMI Formula**: `BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2`\n",
    "  - For example, if a person weighs **70 kg** and is **175 cm** tall:\n",
    "    - Height in meters = 175 cm / 100 = 1.75 meters\n",
    "    - BMI = 70 / (1.75)^2 = 70 / 3.0625 = 22.86 (Normal weight category)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Welcome to the BMI Calculator!\n",
    "Enter your weight (in kg): 70\n",
    "Enter your height (in cm): 175\n",
    "Your BMI is 22.86. Classification: Normal weight\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **BMI Classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5\n",
    "- **Normal weight**: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9\n",
    "- **Overweight**: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9\n",
    "- **Obese**: BMI ≥ 30\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: The program ensures valid weight and height are entered, preventing errors like dividing by zero or non-numeric inputs.\n",
    "- **User Input**: The user is asked for weight (in kg) and height (in cm). If invalid input is entered, the program prompts for input again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Possible Improvements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the user to input height in meters directly.\n",
    "- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using `Tkinter`.\n",
    "- Enhance user experience by allowing them to input weight in pounds and height in inches and automatically converting it to metric units.\n"
